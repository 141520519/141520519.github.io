## My informal letter: 

*Tripoli, Abu Samra* ==(Position: top right)==
*15/1/2025* ==(Position: top right)==

Dear Name,
I hope this message reaches you in the best of health.
How are you doing, great as usual hopefully? I've been thinking about you and your family, and found myself writing this letter for you.
Are you still in college, bachelor if I remember correctly, when will we be seeing you in the graduation dress? As soon as possible inshaa-allah :)
As for me, I've been great, just like the last time we messaged each other, my job is still the same and my routine hasn't changed, not that it's a problem, a peaceful life is all I could hope for :D
Send me a message whenever you get the chance, deal?
Sincerely,
Your most beloved friend,
Nour
